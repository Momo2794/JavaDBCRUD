About this Project

This Project is a example of the CRUD operations.

The Project was build with the IDE Intellij Community Edition, Java 11, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, 
JPA Hibernate and the embedded Relational Database H2. 

It doesn't mean that other DB Engines can't be used in this project. I only used a embedded H2 
Database so that an installation isn't needed.

You can see the whole Data either in the h2-console or by using 'localhost:8080/list-data/all' 
in a browser which shows you the data as JSON.
